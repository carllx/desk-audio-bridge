"""Process runner and ownership supervisor for macOS.

Enforces strict process ownership using POSIX process sessions and local tracking:
- Any spawned pipeline child is started in its own process session (start_new_session=True).
- ONLY project-owned children explicitly launched by this runner are tracked and terminated.
- Termination is performed strictly via stored Popen references / PID / PGID.
- Does NOT scan global process tables.
- Does NOT perform broad/global process kills by name or killall.
